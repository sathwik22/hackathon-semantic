# Vulnerability Report Viewer

> üèÜ Developed during the 2025 Security Innovation Hackathon

A modern React-based web application that revolutionizes the way development teams handle security vulnerability reports. Born from the challenges of managing multiple security scanning tools, this application provides a unified, intuitive interface for analyzing and prioritizing security vulnerabilities detected by Trivy, Grype, and other security scanners.

## Why This Project Exists

In modern DevSecOps practices, development teams often struggle with:

-   Managing outputs from multiple security scanning tools
-   Prioritizing which vulnerabilities to address first
-   Understanding the impact of security findings
-   Maintaining security compliance efficiently
-   Communicating security status across teams

This project, conceived and built during an intensive hackathon, addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, user-friendly dashboard for security vulnerability management.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for most deployments.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can:

1. **View Reports**: The main interface displays vulnerability reports in an easy-to-read format
2. **Filter Results**: Use the severity filter to focus on specific vulnerability levels
3. **Sort Data**: Sort vulnerabilities by different criteria including severity and package name
4. **Expand Details**: Click on any vulnerability to see detailed information
5. **Switch Sources**: Toggle between Trivy, Grype, and combined report views

## Sample Data & API Integration

### Included Sample Reports

The project comes with sample vulnerability reports in the `src` directory:

-   `trivy-report.json`: Sample output from Trivy scanner
-   `grype-report.json`: Sample output from Grype scanner
-   `combined-report.json`: Sample of combined vulnerability data

These files serve as examples of the expected data format and can be used for testing and development purposes.

### API Integration Options

The application supports multiple ways to integrate with security scanners:

1. **Static JSON Files** (current implementation)

    ```javascript
    import trivyData from './trivy-report.json';
    import grypeData from './grype-report.json';
    ```

2. **Mock API Implementation**

    ```javascript
    // mockApi.js
    export const fetchVulnerabilityData = async (scanner) => {
        try {
            // Simulate API delay
            await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

            switch (scanner) {
                case 'trivy':
                    return import('./trivy-report.json');
                case 'grype':
                    return import('./grype-report.json');
                case 'combined':
                    return import('./combined-report.json');
                default:
                    throw new Error('Invalid scanner type');
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching vulnerability data:', error);
            throw error;
        }
    };
    ```

3. **Live API Integration**
    ```javascript
    const API_ENDPOINTS = {
        trivy: '/api/scanners/trivy',
        grype: '/api/scanners/grype',
        combined: '/api/scanners/combined',
    };
    ```
